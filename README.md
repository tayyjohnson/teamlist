# teamlist

In this week's challenge we needed to create a command-line app that accepts user input.
This application will prompt the user's info & when finished, will populate a team roster.

After inputting each team member's info, the user will be taken back to the original menu. 

When the user exits the application, the HTML is generated.

Here is the video link to view the demo of the app: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DKIcXeKMLdE1L1ObIHyX95p_l8zkSswm/view
